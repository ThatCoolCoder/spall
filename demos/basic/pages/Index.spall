<div>
    <p>So here we have some text</p>
    <p>And here is an instantiated element: <Button /></p>
    <p>This instantiated button has some styling: <StyledButton /></p>
    <p>This instantiated button has a callback to itself, which changes the state: <CounterButton counter="5" /></p>

    <RenderCounter />
